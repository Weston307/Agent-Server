Port       = whatever port you choose.
serverName = Either the IP of the server or its name.
	     I chose to run my server on Zeus so my server 	     	     name was zeus.cs.txstate.edu
action     = "#JOIN" "#LEAVE" "#LIST" "#LOG"
             They must have "" around them and a # in front.

To run server.c
	./server Port
Example ./server 30000

To run agent.c
	./agent serverName Port action
Example ./agent zezeus.cs.txstate.edu 30000 "#JOIN"

Note** port does not have to be 30000
Note*** In order to delete the log.txt file after you turn off the server you must go in and delete everyting yourself and then save it. It will keep appending to the end.
